        <p><span class='inline-title' style="background-color:crimson;">Short description of the course</span>
            The main topic of the course is the study of groups via their actions on trees (graphs without closed loops).
            Understanding such actions often gives great insights about the algebraic structure of the acting group.
            After having presented the general theory, the last part of the course will focus on its applications and on related topics in geometric group theory.
        </p>
        <p><span class='inline-title' style="background-color:crimson;">Prerequisites</span>
            We expect familiarity with:
            <ul>
               <li>Basic group theory (homomorphisms, actions on sets...);</li>
               <li>Very few fundamentals in topology like fundamental groups and covering maps.</li>
            </ul>
            Later in the course, we will make some use of singular homology of topological spaces, but the "core part" of the course will not use it.
